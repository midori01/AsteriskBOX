# Developing sing-ebpf

This guide describes the repository workflow for changes to BPF programs,
generated objects, Go control-plane code, capability fallbacks, and network
resource lifecycles. Read [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) first when changing
package boundaries or ownership.

## Supported development lines

- `dev` follows the sing-box testing/development dependency line.
- `main` remains compatible with the stable/backport consumer line.

Do not update `github.com/sagernet/sing`, `netlink`, `x/sys`, `x/net`, or
`netipx` in isolation merely to obtain a newer revision. Align them with the
consumer line, review semantic changes used by this module, and verify both the
library and consumer. `github.com/cilium/ebpf` may be updated independently only
when Android/Linux support and generated-object behavior remain compatible.

The module must not use a sing-box or sing-tun fork. The dependency direction
is always consumer → sing-ebpf.

## Repository map

| Location | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `native/` | BPF C programs, shared parsers/policy helpers, and C ABI declarations |
| `internal/bpfgen/` | Checked-in little-/big-endian objects, generated Go bindings, and source/object manifest |
| `internal/core/` | Raw maps/programs/FDs, loaders, capability selection, probes, and low-level lifecycle owners |
| root package | Public value types, policy compilation, backend façades, flow operations, and capability results |
| `runtime/` | TC/TCX attachment, routes/rules, veth/sysctl ownership, topology reconciliation, health, and rollback |
| `testing/checksumoffload/` | Real-NIC checksum and segmentation-offload verification tool |

Raw kernel handles must stay below `internal/core`. Adding a public accessor to
an `ebpf.Map`, `ebpf.Program`, link FD, filter handle, or netlink resource is a
boundary change, not a convenience method.

## Choose the correct layer

Before editing, classify the requirement:

- packet parsing, policy decision, rewrite/assignment, or a kernel counter:
  `native/` plus the mirrored Go ABI and generated objects;
- map/program construction, feature probing, attachment primitive, or raw
  cleanup: `internal/core`;
- topology, route/rule, qdisc/filter, veth, sysctl, retry, and transaction:
  `runtime/`;
- application configuration, DNS/FakeIP meaning, listener/session behavior,
  route rules, package names, process cache, logging, or API output: consumer.

If a generic library feature was motivated by FakeIP or another application
concept, name it by its mechanism (`force_intercept`, prefix priority, flow
metadata), not by the consumer feature.

## Ordinary Go changes

The library is build-tagged for Linux/Android eBPF consumers. Run:

```sh
go test -tags with_ebpf ./...
go test -race -tags with_ebpf ./...
go vet -tags with_ebpf ./...
```

Changes to public APIs also require a consumer build with and without
`with_ebpf`. A build without the tag and a process without an eBPF inbound must
not install hooks, change dial behavior, create goroutines, or touch kernel
network state.

## BPF C and generated objects

Generation is intentionally reproducible and pinned to Android NDK r29 Clang
21. Normal consumers use checked-in objects and need neither cgo nor the NDK.

Set `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` when r29 is not installed at the Makefile default, then
run:

```sh
make generate
make check
```

`make generate`:

1. clears host include-path environment variables;
2. compiles every selected object for `bpfel` and `bpfeb` with `-mcpu=v1`;
3. strips BTF and CO-RE sections;
4. regenerates Go bindings; and
5. records generator, dependency, source, and object hashes in
   `internal/bpfgen/manifest.txt`.

Commit C sources, Go ABI changes, both endian object variants, bindings, and the
manifest together. Never make CI the only place that regenerates objects, and
never hand-edit generated `.go`, `.o`, or manifest content.

### ABI checklist

For every C structure used as a map key/value or control record:

1. compare C and Go size, alignment, field offsets, signedness, byte order, and
   reserved bytes;
2. initialize every key byte, including padding;
3. add or update compile-time C assertions and Go layout tests;
4. check map type, key/value size, flags, maximum entries, and per-CPU shape for
   replacements;
5. regenerate both endiannesses and run manifest freshness checks; and
6. load every affected object variant on a real kernel.

Changing only the Go mirror while leaving an embedded object untouched can
compile successfully and still corrupt lookup semantics.

## Capability and fallback changes

Kernel release numbers are not positive capability evidence. Vendor kernels
backport and disable facilities independently. A new optional path needs:

- a probe for the exact map, program type, helper, link or attach flag used;
- representative object loading when verifier behavior matters;
- a deterministic fallback that does not reference the unavailable facility;
- runtime diagnostics for the path that actually loaded/attached; and
- tests that force the primary path to fail and prove the fallback semantics.

The Linux 6.6 LPM-trie defect is the deliberate exception: probing by updating
the map can itself fault affected kernels, so the safety deny-list and positive
BTF evidence are kept separate from ordinary capability selection.

Current important fallbacks include TCX → owned `clsact`, SOCKMAP-capable TCP →
legacy TCP lookup, cgroup socket-release notification → bounded LRU cleanup,
and cgroup multi-program → compatible legacy exclusive attachment. Do not turn
an optional fallback failure into a silent feature claim; diagnostics must name
the effective path.

## Lifecycle and concurrency review

Trace construction, successful start, partial start, reconcile, and close.
Every resource must have one owner and appear in reverse-order cleanup. Verify:

- interception is enabled only after listeners, maps, attachments, routes, and
  required sysctls are ready;
- a failed replacement preserves the last working state or reports why it was
  disabled;
- a non-nil owner returned with an error remains closeable and retained until
  cleanup succeeds;
- `Close` is idempotent and retries partial detach/restore failures;
- only positively owned qdiscs, filters, routes, rules, links, locks, and
  sysctls are removed;
- workers are cancellable and joined; timers do not create idle wakeups without
  a concrete unobservable state to check; and
- callbacks are never invoked while holding a lock they can re-enter.

Shared runtime notifications are delivered after releasing the runtime lock.
`PrepareBackend` is different: it is a synchronous factory inside the
reconciliation transaction and must not call back into the runtime.

## Test layers

Keep each test tied to a current contract. Delete a test and its fixtures when
the production path it protects is removed, or when another test exercises the
same preconditions and assertions at the same layer. Do not retain tests merely
to prevent a deleted implementation from returning.

Conversely, rarity is not a reason to remove rollback, detach-failure,
resource-ownership, concurrency, verifier, ABI, or compatibility-fallback
tests. Prefer one table-driven family/framing/data-plane matrix to parallel
wrappers, and keep implementation-shape assertions only where the shape itself
is contractual, such as helper usage or C/Go ABI layout.

Tests that require root, network namespaces, real maps/programs, or kernel
attachment must use the `ebpf_integration` build tag. Ordinary unit tests should
not attempt a privileged operation and silently skip; this keeps the default
suite deterministic while the privileged CI remains authoritative for real
kernel behavior.

### Unit, race, vet, and generation

Run the ordinary Go commands above plus `make check`. Tests should cover the
smallest value-level policy/ABI rule and injected failure before relying on a
network namespace.

### Privileged real-kernel tests

On a disposable Linux host or VM with root privileges:

```sh
sudo env \
  "PATH=$PATH" \
  SING_EBPF_INTEGRATION=1 \
  go test -v -count=1 -race \
    -tags with_ebpf,ebpf_integration \
    ./...
```

Set `SING_EBPF_REQUIRE_TCX=1` only on a host where TCX is expected and should be
a hard requirement. The normal integration suite must also exercise `clsact`
fallback instead of treating TCX as universally available.

The privileged matrix should cover all affected combinations:

- IPv4 and IPv6; TCP and UDP;
- local TC and cgroup; shared socket assignment and packet rewrite;
- Ethernet and supported raw-IP framing where applicable;
- object-load and attach fallback selection;
- interface absence, recreation, role change, and ifindex reuse;
- route/rule collision, partial startup, detach failure, and cleanup retry;
- fragmented packet pass behavior and pass/failure counters;
- UDP flow creation, reply restoration, timeout, release, queue pressure, and
  map-capacity behavior; and
- FakeIP-independent force-intercept prefixes and ICMP responder paths when
  changed.

### Real device and NIC tests

Android vendor behavior, netd coexistence, SELinux, cgroup delegation, raw-IP
rmnet framing, hotspot transitions, and power/wakeup behavior require a real
device. Packet rewrite and checksum changes additionally require the physical
NIC procedure in `testing/checksumoffload`; veth/virtio tests cannot expose
firmware offload defects.

Record the exact kernel, device, build fingerprint, configuration, selected
runtime paths, before/after diagnostics, and graceful cleanup. A probe result
alone is not an attachment or traffic test.

## Debugging evidence

For verifier failures, retain the complete verifier log and identify the exact
object/program variant. For runtime failures, collect:

- active attachment descriptions and effective mechanisms;
- first error and timestamp, recovery state, and retry deadline;
- map occupancy/capacity and relevant failure/pass counters before and after a
  controlled flow;
- routes, rules, links, qdiscs and filters owned by the test; and
- pstore/dmesg for any kernel fault.

Avoid adding packet-path logging or periodic full-map scans as diagnostics.
Prefer per-event/per-CPU counters and request-driven inspection.

## Consumer integration checklist

Before updating a consumer revision:

1. compare its `sing`, `netlink`, `x/sys`, `x/net`, and `netipx` versions with
   this branch;
2. review APIs and semantics used for socket controls, UDP OOB/batch I/O,
   process ownership, network updates, listener close/error behavior, and route
   metadata;
3. build the consumer with and without its eBPF tag;
4. run its adapter tests for configuration, listener/session ownership,
   diagnostics, and shutdown; and
5. verify the library commit is reachable before committing a consumer
   dependency update.

No textual conflict and a successful compile are not compatibility evidence.
Upstream implementations can change error, EOF, locking, caching, or lifecycle
semantics without changing a function signature.

## Documentation and release gate

Update README/architecture/development documentation when ownership, a public
API, a fallback, a runtime path, or the generated toolchain changes. Consumer
documentation owns application configuration and user-visible behavior.

Before publishing a library revision, require:

```text
go test -tags with_ebpf ./...
go test -race -tags with_ebpf ./...
go vet -tags with_ebpf ./...
make check
privileged real-kernel tests for affected paths
consumer builds with and without eBPF support
```

Keep implementation commits reviewable and independently revertible. A release
tag marks a tested compatibility point; it should not be created for every
commit.
